Anne lost control and laughed
Billy wrote on the envelope
He called over his shoulder
He stayed against the wall
Helen ran to the toilet
I cannot tell you more
Michael gave Adam two pounds
Roger smiled and sat down
Things were looking up again
This man 's hair is black
Turn your hearing aid up
You 'll demand nothing of me
A horse has thrown a shoe
A tube train took his legs
Five will be listening for sure
Gordon felt his anger build up
Harry smiled at his little brother
He needed putting in his place
He shouted and the calling ceased
He uses his belt on you
He 's broken his wrists very badly
I am touched deeply in places
I do n't want to hear it
I knew I heard your voice
I would n't want to miss this
Jack walked up to the door
Ross sat back down and shivered
She could n't help feel for Alex
The bored looking soldier just pointed
The campaign will pay for itself
They 're riding out to meet them
We barely escaped with our lives
We 've been travelling almost three days
Alice is looking for somewhere to live
Alan forgot to shave again this morning
Have a carriage sent for us immediately
He probably does n't want people to know
He put the fork on the table
I 'll give him more than a slap
Andrew nodded and stood against the counter
Looks like a walk did the trick
Sam felt proud when he went home
Scott got up and washed his plate
Simon nodded and walked into the room
Steve sat down to eat his lunch
Ted smiled and bit his bottom lip
Thomas stepped back and shook his head
Tom stood up and wiped his jeans
Tony stopped off at his first delivery
Normally they want to cut things up
Powerful in the wrong hands , is that
She had refused to leave her home
She hid the boxes and matches well
The bored looking soldier continued looking bored
The dead must not kill the living
The prison guard walked along the row
The van is your lead , follow that
You 're getting up early in the morning
After lunch he was told he had visitors
Albert spoke before Barbara had a chance to
Come within the walls to escape the enemy
Follow me closely and watch for their leader
He called out but she did not move
He sat down and began to eat breakfast
He slammed the knife down on the lamb
He staggered into the chair at his desk
I do not spare the birds a killing
I think our friend 's demands are well justified
Let us leave these poor people in peace
Walter closed the door and took a breath
William sat down and tucked into his breakfast
Alec stood against the wall to steady himself
No-one else had dared step within the ring
None of the city people dress like that
She saw the throwing knife in his hand
She was smiling in the dark , teeth flashing
Shut your smart foul mouth and sit down
Tell me what really happened to the truck
The door was opened and Alexander walked out
There were choked screams and shouts of dismay
There will be men to kill either way
They were definitely holding hands underneath the table
Claudia still teaches and still claims to hate it
Burn him now , do n't wait for him to escape
Do n't die of cold before you die in battle
Good God , if you are watching , give me strength
He heaved his shoulders and swung the axe again
He is after glory and heads for his hall
He just wished he could talk to his dad
He lay his sword aside and extended his hands
He sighed and walked back to the wood shop
He smiled when she let out a big yawn
He was leaning against his truck smoking a joint
I was thinking of getting the band together again
It is a narrow ship , much like our own
Arthur placed the bars of chocolate on the counter
John gave Bernard a hard slap on the head
Let 's get out and I 'll buy you a drink
Let 's have the gates closed and go home early
Andrew closed the office door on the way out
Charles felt sick to the pit of his stomach
Christopher groaned and lay his hands across his stomach
Dave kicked him in the stomach and Paul groaned
Dexter opened his letter and found a photograph inside
Duncan took a breath and wanted to be sick
Edward washed his hands and flicked water at Bob
She turned and saw him standing in her path
They turned round just as Frankie walked toward them
Underneath the table her hand was gripping the chair
Whether Peter heard him or not Gabriel did n't care
You give me a lead and I 'll follow it
All the bowls from the empty tables are cleared up
His dark hair was just visible under his white hat
His men will not follow him and they are few
I 'll break your neck if you do n't fix that water
Ian gave Geoffrey a hard slap across his right ear
Jake smiled again at his baby daughter , she was perfect
Jimmy liked the fact they were calling him Jim
Brian sniffed and wiped his grubby hand across his nose
Phil let him go and Charlie fell to the ground
Let me through and you 'll hear nothing more of it
Men could be paid to do all sorts of things
Gilbert sat as still as he could nursing his lip
Jacques sighed and tried to move out of the way
Jamie took a cigarette and Andy gave him a light
Joseph walked into the office and removed his flat cap
She would soon be found if she tried to hide
The brothers stood up and came down from the platform
Anthony was approached , just as he had predicted , in the park
Despite what Frank had told her Ellen thanked the young soldier
He called earlier and I already arranged to go swimming tomorrow
He drove his truck home and walked down to the village
He held his mother tight and she cried into his chest
He went to the door and walked out of the room
His helmet was lost but he could still do some damage
Ken just hoped he was n't taking his temper out on Chris
Lawrence rubbed the back of his neck and hung his head
Lewis sat down and Lucy laid her hand on his cheek
Matthew stood against the wall with his hands behind his back
Run along home now and bring us some men to kill
She just kept telling herself he had to learn a lesson
She wound up talking to Barry about her time in India
The gate was double , one huge mass of wood following another
The gathered villagers took a step back , almost as one man
We shall arrive properly or you will never live this down
While they sat drinking their tea , Mick dug them a trench
You know better than to talk to your mother like that
You know that I will do whatever you ask of me
You should n't have been racing my truck in the first place
A smile came to his lips as he thought of an idea
All last week there was a white van parked across the street
Finally Maria sat down with a cup of tea and a sandwich
Have that carriage sent down and have servants bring wine and water
He did n't seem to mind that she was screaming in his ear
He drank too much at times and washed too little at times
He folded his arms across his chest and put out his lip
He had another shock when they told him he was moving cells
He put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the truck
He was built with muscle and liked to throw his weight around
I am trying , old man , but I would rather kill the ship
I shall have a victory and I want it to be remembered
In the morning Mickey stood straight with his hand behind his back
In the morning at breakfast Mike smiled at the letter he received
It had been two weeks since Philip had been sent to prison
It is not the most fragrant of places but we make do
James walked in to wake Samuel at four thirty in the morning
David came running into the waiting room and went straight to Stephen
Dennis was standing at the entrance to the workshop smiling at Terry
Let us give battle to these foreign snakes once and for all
Tommy came out of the staff room toilet looking a little pale
Adam hoped she was knocked out cold and would n't wake till morning
Michael knew they never hit him and that was half the problem
Alan told Jason he would just sit outside to have his lunch
Now the man is coming who will give it back to me
She threatened to leave before and this time she just had enough
The first knife caught in her skirt and she shook it free
The last thing Alex felt like doing after work was more work
The truck was an older version of the ones the others drove
They stared at the black wall and now this offered no comfort
They were halfway through breakfast when a guard walked up with mail
We should talk about the things people talk about on first dates
Why do n't you tell me what happened on Saturday , step by step
Emma put her mug of tea down on the table with a bang
Benjamin dashed out of the door and glanced up and down the street
Bruce is looking for someone to take the spare room in his flat
From the moment we leave this spot be very careful what you say
He knocked on the door so hard that he almost broke it down
He let Donald go and he fell to the floor with a thud
He smiled again and felt like a man and not just the kid
He 's got the ability to work but he just gets bored too easy
Her ambition offered no thought to the men standing behind and around her
I ca n't see any amount of talk getting you out of this mess
I flung out my hands and they said I had broken my wrists
I mostly just pick a dry white and drink it to get drunk
Andy felt good when he got ready to go out on Saturday night
Arthur got in his truck and slammed his fist against the steering wheel
Billy knocked on the door and waited till he was told to enter
Bob sat at the entrance to the warehouse and made up a cigarette
Brian sat down at an empty table and began to eat his breakfast
Charlie walked home slowly so that he could smoke one of his cigarettes
One by one she placed her teeth about their necks and killed them
The shout caught him off guard and he fell back a little way
They probably just talked about medieval folk music anyway and it was boring
Within four months they moved in together to the flat on Shakespeare Road
After only a night 's journey by sea they had travelled into the South proper
Every free man had a right to speak gathered at the calling of Council
He had a headache and every drop sounded like an arrow piercing his skull
He had money whenever he wanted it and still the best truck in town
He rose from his seat and stopped mid way when Joe glared at him
He sat his son up on the table and laid his belt beside him
If I have time at the end I 'll fill you in on what happened
Chris carefully carried Eddie to his truck and laid him on the back seat
Colin drove into the garage to wash the truck and fill it with petrol
David finally got to eat his lunch then went back to digging the trench
Dennis noticed someone standing in front of him when he reached for another log
Donald sat down at the kitchen table and fed his little sister her bottle
Frank sighed and walked to the visiting room with his hands in his pockets
Fred walked into the kitchen on Saturday morning to find his mother making breakfast
George was led inside and they made him strip and gave him a uniform
Harry was whistling and singing to himself for the whole of the next day
Henry washed his hands and sat on the seat in front of the stove
She tried hard to bring him up right and teach him right from wrong
The bored soldier pressed a button which opened the gate and allowed them in
The curious thing was , on the Friday night , that the garden gate was shut
The first thing she noticed when she walked into the house was the silence
The police officer got out of the van and picked up the two cans
The speaker turned to her with a smile and a bow of his head
They say he can breathe fire and kill a man with a single word
When she had fallen , the witnesses to her death would have cut her apart
He came back to his senses when he heard his dad stand up to him
He could hear men shouting , screaming as though all of hell was at their heels
He did as he was told and tucked in his shirt and straightened his tie
He had jobs and lost jobs , he never had what you could call a career
He put his hand on the little boy 's shoulder and gave it an encouraging squeeze
He was already up and dressed and invited us in for a cup of tea
His smile soon faded to a frown when he heard what Keith had to say
I ask that my people be allowed to stay behind and tend to the wounded
I have n't lost a single man though they 're hardly in a fit state to fight
I know Richard drinks a little too much and has a bit of a temper
I remember an agent with no arms who could kill a man with his teeth
If this were a movie instead of a book this would be a good bit
If you have n't seen it yet all that means is you are n't looking hard enough
Kevin had struck the belt across his legs and hit his fingers in the process
Hugh got up and picked up the bucket and placed it back on the floor
Ian sighed when Howard handed him the brush and sent him out to the yard
James was only in the cell for an hour but it felt like a week
Somehow Jason just kept quiet and did as they told him without any smart comments
That night he had never felt so scared since he had been sent to prison
To his mum and dad he was just another mouth they could n't afford to feed
A smart efficient looking girl in a military uniform sat behind a desk reading Heat magazine
Jane had worn a suit in the belief that it might make her look less suspicious
At ground level , by the wall , a ditch gathered water and dead rats crowded the ground
He turned to the crowd who stood quietly waiting to see how the battle would turn
He walked into the kitchen a while after dinner dressed in his best jeans and shirt
I would not have you abandon what we have won to chase after that woman 's life
If they do n't approach me at any of those places then we 'll know they do n't care
Just as he was about to give up and go back he heard a second noise
No one had ever cared about him so much as to threaten his dad like that
She is wearing a cardigan over a purple blouse and a faded old red cotton skirt
She was served by an incredibly striking girl with bright blue hair and a Polish accent
The longer you waste time in talk , the more certain it is that you will lose
They followed the stairs down two flights and walked through a door into a reception room
We do n't even need to build the boat , the native villagers have plenty that would do
As soon as they taste cold steel they 'll flee back to their mountains as they did before
Do n't tell me any more about the crime , in fact , do n't tell me any more full stop
He sets out to prove them wrong by holding down a job and trying to act responsible
In a moment , before anyone could stop him , he had driven his sword into his own stomach
Joe had survived his first week of work and felt good to have money in his pocket
Keith walked into the cell and climbed up on his bed and lay staring at the ceiling
Douglas followed his father to his office and Kevin knew from looking in the window they were arguing
He had lived with his mother till she died after a long and painful fight with lung cancer
He had to get himself in gear and stop getting into trouble and this time he meant it
He had walked so far since the battle and every step now seemed to him like a year
He put his hands to his sword and heard the song rush through his blood louder than ever
He stared down the narrow pass as though expecting some challenge to issue from the mouth of it
He walked up to the office and knocked on the door waiting till he was told to enter
I did n't read the local papers and neither did my parents so I had not heard about it
Luke kicked off his boots and shrugged off his jacket and slammed his cap down on the hook
Malcolm woke Lewis at six in the morning and told him to wear his worst jeans and shirt
Mark stopped in his tracks on the way to the table and stood in front of the stove
Martin went to get washed up for lunch then spent the afternoon working on the extension with Mark
The driver slowed down , pulled over and got out , which was really a terrible mistake on his part
The people need a champion to follow , to open the wall in battle and give them an opening
Whenever she and Clark had tried to talk just between the two of them the subject had wandered
Colin and Julie walked across a parade ground past a lot of men walking around in uniform carrying guns
Damian is not normally a man of action so now , stirred into action , he looks like he means business
Derek reached for the statement and placed it in a more prominent position , the better to remember it later
Dick sat down at the table and took the cup of tea that Karen placed in front of him
Henry came out of his office and found Neil standing against the wall with his hands in his pockets
He could tell by the look of him and his actions that Robert had been hitting the drink again
He owned the garage in town and was trusted to do maintenance on all the cars in the village
Rachel for no reason at all dropped the fish slice on the floor and ran from the room crying
I am a man of the dead and I have felt the anguish of those passing through my hands
Martin decided to step in when they asked everyone but Nigel along for a pint after work on Friday
Matt thought the best way to have a talk with Patrick would be to take him for a pint
We could not keep them in the country , they had farms to return to , services drawing to an end
As soon as I got off the phone with the pet store man I rang Gerry and told him everything
Graham took a long drink from his beer as if to signal that that was an end to the matter
Harvey longed for a son to carry on the family name and talked of little else in his letters home
He slumped down on the chair by the fire in a heap like his whole body had suddenly got heavy
He stood up as straight as he could with his hands behind his back and tried not to look scared
He wrenched one arm from the man 's grasp and used it to pull the man 's ankles out from beneath him
His lips were blue and though just conscious he was in no shape to walk , talk or even breathe well
I considered it to be the minimum information I could give out in order to bring the situation under control
The next night after tea and locked in the cell for the night , Paul decided to write to his mum
The water of the river seems to battle against the army , dragging at their legs , trying to pull them under
They had been allowing their voices to rise and as the debate continued the rest of the crowd caught on
They stop in the nearest village to water the horses but the men must do without if they mind sharing
To one side , out of sight of the priests on the steps of their temple , was a circle of stones
We have been given this voice , in a language that is not our own , with which to tell our story
He carries an axe as long as your arm and he can split a man from head to toe with it
He ought to have seen the patrol coming , should have spotted their track , noticed the way the forest was on edge
Sophie came back in and began to make Morgan his breakfast while he sat drinking his coffee and reading the paper
My nose was and continues to be broken , also my ribs and legs were bruised after the collision with the wheelchair
Putting himself between Fred and his dad could only do more harm than good at least that 's what Neil told him
They have never come this way before and so the hour of their arrival is strange if they wish to trade
By the time he got home he was feeling a little light headed and felt like he could take on the world
He made a funny noise and shook his head and raised his hands to indicate that he was useless at describing people
Once he 'd chopped just about half , he stuck the axe into the chopping block and made his way inside to have breakfast
Unlike the television in the kitchen or the chairs in the lounge or much in the flat , the stereo was not dusty
Kate propped herself up on her elbows , her wine glass standing in the tall grass besides her , and announced that we should talk
He stood over the small sofa at the other end of his office and watched the small figure curl up under his jacket
In the distance , the walls appeared as the outline of a great dragon , curled and sleeping , back to the wind and wings folded
Peter went to bed giving himself his word that while Hugh was n't around he 'd look out for George as much as he could
There was a pause , then the distant rattle of stone on stone , followed closely by its echo from the high mountain walls behind
Ever devoted to his wife he was at her side in the delivery room when she gave birth to a baby girl in 1978
Sue shook her head as she watched Nicholas give up on fighting to stay awake and fall asleep on the chair by the fire
If you had asked him seconds after visiting the bar what colour the girl 's hair was he would have probably turned around to look
Phil ran up to the water tank , his mum would kill Nigel if she knew he 'd sent him up the hill without a jacket
The following day it was made clear to Laura , if not in so many words , that she really needed to be moving out soon
The very streets seemed to know the gossip , it passed from head to head not by mouth but seemingly by sheer power of will
Mary had absolutely no idea what the woman was talking about but there were few things that annoyed her more than adults reading children 's books
Sarah is not in a wheelchair , she is not big and strong , top half or bottom , and she does not speak with an American accent
He could see a paying job just about to slip out of his fingers and he knew he had to act fast to save it
If he does decide to do anything , he 'll fill their bones with fire , put ashes in their lights and blow them past the last river
If you were coming from the high street you had to walk past three or four perfectly good pubs to get to The Three Cups
Just as Margaret was setting out tea , Patrick came in still in his work clothes and washed his hands in the water in the basin
Richard sat down on the chair in front of the stove and tucked into his tea with the warmth of the stove on his back
There was no television in the lounge , there was a small one in the kitchen but in the lounge all seats faced the record player
There was not an enemy within a hundred miles and they were trading a path their kind had not taken for many , many a year
Susan would be a cat person , she wanted a pet that could look after itself and , if it loved her , would love her as an equal
Despite all the publicity he was getting there was still one thing Robert knew he had to do before he could clear his conscience for good
He went to get on his boots and Ian stuck out his foot and Roger fell over it and landed on the floor with a thud
Jenny went to the sitting room while Ross finished off his tea and washed up his dishes then went for a bath and straight to bed
Sam slid down the wall and sat with his knees against his chest and folded his arms across them and put his head down on them
Now that he was master , had his own affairs and his own men to command , he was less inclined to be ordered about by his wife
For now we must go on with our lives and act as normal , which right now means drinking beer and talking rubbish like we used to do
From here she could not see the gate but she knew that it would stand wide and gaping , welcoming the night in , and all that it held
He still felt a little drunk but not as bad as he was earlier but that did n't stop him falling in the door and waking everyone up
I ca n't imagine what else you would have been talking to him about except a certain matter that I believe you said you would not talk about
She also says to tell you that you will not be able to rely on the land , not once you are under the shadow of the walls
Slowly , very slowly , he placed the tips of his fingers on the ground and felt the power flowing through the earth to the stones touch his ability
The door was slammed shut behind him and Scott slid down the wall right to the floor not even noticing the two other men in the cell
Caroline picked up the empty dishes from the table and piled them on the side of the sink and began to clean up the crumbs on the table
In the morning it felt good to get up and not have to wait for an inspection or get told when to go to the bathroom or have breakfast
When she had gone to make a cup of tea she had noticed a small hair stuck to the moist lip of the kettle and , without thinking , had gone to remove it
Simon lay staring at the ceiling again with his arms behind his head and thinking about his mum , he hoped she was n't worrying too much and hoped they 'd get to visit him soon
Paula tried to relax back into the pillow to drift off a little , to enjoy listening to the world , but the morning was shot , it was ruined and there was no getting it back
He kept his stock books neat and checked them every day and Steve knew he urged his son Kenneth to be nothing less than respectable and made sure he was polite with their customers
Tom walked into the visiting room glad that his mum was making it back to see him so quickly or at least when they told him he had a visitor he assumed it was his mum
She seemed to show some interest in Tony fixing the truck and asked a lot of questions and even liked it when he let her fix some things and she did n't seem to mind getting covered in oil
